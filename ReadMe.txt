Description:
The objective of the game Campo Drive is for the Campo car to collide with the pink donuts. Each donut is worth 20 points, and to win, the user must gain 300 
points. However, the user has to be careful because they only have three lives to begin with. If they collide with a zombie, they will lose one of their lives. 
Additionally, the user can gain one of their lives back by colliding with the Colgate toothpaste object. To make the game harder or easier, the player is allowed 
to make the game go faster or slower.


Details of custom features: 
The player is always dropping down unless the user constantly presses the up key. The player can no longer go left or right. Their speed to go down is faster 
than their speed to go up. Also, there is a level of difficulty as time passes by. By the 1000th tick, two zombies will come at the same time, and by the 2500th 
tick, three zombies will start to spawn at the same time. Additionally, when the player is on their last life, the Rare_Get will spawn. 
This object is the Colgate toothpaste, and when the car collides with it, the player's life will increase by one HP (lives), and there is a maximum of lives they 
can get, which is 3. 

Win or lose conditions: 
To win, the user must collide with 15 donuts (a score of 300) and still maintain their lives. The user will lose if all their lives equal zero. 
This will happen when the car collides with the zombies, and their lives will decrement by one.
